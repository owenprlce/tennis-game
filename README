This is a fun side project I have been working on when I have had time.

It is still in its early stage of development, and I play to increase complexity of the implementation
    -Adding abstraction, and polymorphism (if needed for player archetypes and so on)
    -Adding unprogrammed gamemode mechanics such as logic that can simulate a tie breaker in a match, and if players want to play ad tennis
    -More options for a game player to choose player attributes
    -Simulate player gameplay, or virtual tennis tornament brackets?
    -...

I may change direction with this project to leverage knowledge and skills attained from a computer graphics course I am taking 
in order to add a graphical aspect to the game.
